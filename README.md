a web based rss news reader

Dear Friend, this isn't a github project anymore. Please visit the project homepage: https://pseudopolis.eu/wiki/pino/projs/ginger/

Ginger is a news reader for rss news feeds. Once it is hosted in
a web server, a user can login and read her news in the web browser.

Features:

- multi-user web application
- multiple news feeds per user
- message tagging
- powerful message filtering
- very customizable
- scripting interface

It is based on Django and Python and is real-world tested to run in Apache with the wsgi module on Debian Linux.
